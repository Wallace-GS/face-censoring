# Face Censorship

This little project uses the FaceDetector API to detect your face and censor it for maximum webcam security.

On this website.

Which is the only place where it will work.

And only if you turn your webcam on. And enable Chrome's Experimental Web Platform features.

Okay, it may not be super useful in this context but it's pretty cool. And check it out, here's a puppy! (it only works on humans :sweat_smile:)
