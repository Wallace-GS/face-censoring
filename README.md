# Face Censorship

This little project uses the FaceDetector API to detect your face and censor it for maximum webcam security (on this website :sweat_smile:).

_If you would like to see it in action, make sure you go to chrome://flags/ and enable 'Experimental Web Platform' features. Then head on over to https://wallace-gs.github.io/face-censoring/_

Or check out this sample with my pup :dog:! (it only works on humans)
